Then no one want you to know that no one is telling you because they want to sell. Give me product. You guys that don't actually work and I'm gonna be sharing with you guys. An easy tips and tricks you can do on your own that I know work because I've tried and tested them over the last few years and my hair is basically the proof the putting so that for you if you want to know what my rapid hair growth secrets are just keep watching. So my first.In hair growth, secret is using Castor oil on your hair and not just any kind of Castor oil, because all cast oils are made very very differently and therefore they're not like. But my personal favorite, Castor oil to use is the Brio Jio be well, my personal favorite way of using this Castor oil is just massage in, get into my scalp few hours before I know I'm gonna wash my hair if I remember or if I have a time I try to do the night before. The longer you leave the Castor oil on your scalp more the cast or will have a chance to penetrate into the scalp and work.It's magic and I want to share another secret. You guys. I not only love using this Castor oil on my scalp, you guys ask me all the time about what I use on my lashes and my browse to get my browser phone to get my lashes so long and thick. And it's because I've been using just natural oils essential oils on my eyelashes on a daily basis to grow them. And recently this has been my favorite already is put a little bit of the be well Castor oil on a little Clean Master school you can pick up a huge pack hours like of Amazon for dirt cheap and then I just brushed.What's your through my eyelashes? I do this twice a day before I go to bad in the morning and I'm telling you guys, this is like the best eyelash growth secrets. It's 100% natural, 100% effective, so if you haven't tried it out I had recommend you do so if you go on the bridge hair.com website only the link down below you can get 10% of this product as well as anything on the brio your website. So in conjunction with using the by well Castor oil I also like.Adding a couple of techniques to really speed up the whole hair growth process. What my favorite ways of doing that is by gently massage in my scalp so I will use my fingertips. Just a software you don't want to use your nails because you gonna scratch your scalp and cause your attention. You just want to use like the iPad or your fingertips to really massage the oiling your scalp. This is gonna help bring blood circulation to the scalp. Is gonna help open up the pores on the scalp so there gonna be more ready to absorb all the amazing nutrients in the cast oils the vitamin E and Omega fatty acids.It's super relaxing, so why not another check that I like to do to really help the cast oil absorbent. My scalp better is to use indirect heat. So what I do is I apply the Castor oil to my scalp and then I'll cover my head in a shower cap and then I will use the heat from a blow dryer to kind of warm up my scalp for about 5 minutes or so. This is essentially going to do the same thing as a massage so it's gonna help increase blood circulation. It's gonna open up the pores.Gonna help kind of melts the cast oil a little bit so it's a little bit more fluid and it can absorb into the scalp a lot better. And it's a great little check that I like to use now and then. Another technique that I like to use in conjunction with the Castor oil is the inversion method. I'm not sure if you guys heard of this before. I have mentioned on my channel few times before. Basically what it is you apply the oil to your scalp and then you want to flip your head upside down for a couple minutes or so and why your head is upside down. You can massage your head. Basically this done.Pretty much the exact same thing as the other 2 methods. It helps bring blood circulation to the scalp. A lot of people who do this on a regular basis say that it really, really helps accelerates hair grow. I personally think that all 3 technique share with you guys, the scalp massage, the indirect heat engine version method, or all really really great for helping to Excelerate hair growth. So just really depends on how much time you have and what you in the mood for for that day. So just want to share 3 of my personal favorite technique that I've been using.The Brio Jio be well cast oil that I swear why the next tip want to share with you guys? That is really gonna help your hair look healthier and become longer and thicker is to use natural hair care products. I've been a natural hair care and skin care advocate for a very very long time. You guys know that if you can follow me on this channel for a long time and if you follow me on my second channel. Nikki Sky always always talk to you guys about using natural products because they are formulated without any harmful chemicals like parabens.Sulfates, Nsls that is basically going to destruct the page balance on your scalp. It's going to clog the pores on your scalp. They're usually filled with a lot of chemicals and preservatives that are not good for your overall hair help or your health in general. So thats why I always steer clear of any kind of product that have questionable chemicals. I always make sure to read the ingredients labels on all of the product that I put onto my hair or onto my skin, and I highly recommend you guys are doing the same. I've eaten videos on this channel of natural hair.Products that I use and love and swear by. But if you want a one stop shop for the best natural hair care products. I cannot recommend Brio Jio email. The next thing I would recommend doing on a regular basis is detoxing your scalp. I personally have not realise how important this is until about a year ago when I discovered the Brio Jio Charcoal shampoo. I think it is called. It is like this dark grey green tea kind of shampoo. I use it probably.3 times a month and I cannot tell you what a difference it has made in the overall health of MySQL. My scalp, my skin in general is very very dry, and especially when you're going through the seasonal transitions here in Canada, it can be very, very dramatic. It takes a huge toll on my skin, so usually when we transition from Season 2 season, my scalp is has a crazy freak out. It's flaking. It's getting really itchy and my hair doesn't look as lustrous and shiny is it? Normally does and that's what I know that it's time to detox my scalp, so I will use the.JoJo Detox shampoo on my scalp. All massage into my scalp. It has like a very greedy texture so feel like exfoliate your scalp a little bit. Its a very very gentle. It's great for all skin types and hair types. It has a very minty sent to it's all massage into my Skype and leave it on for few minutes while I do the rest of my business in my shower and then rinse, sit out and it literally gets all the gunk out of my hair. Gets all the dead skin out of my scalp and my scalp just looks and feels so.Clean so I highly recommend doing a scalp detox at least once or twice a month, especially if you use a lot of product in your hair because a lot of the product be put in our hair like dry shampoos and serums and oils. They're really really difficult to wash out with normal shampoo so thats why I recommend using the detox once in awhile to really help get all of that great out of your hair. Another tip I want to share with you guys is to try to leave your hair down is much as possible now. You're probably wondering how is it gonna help me achieve.Ignore healthier hair and that's because every time we pull hair back into a bun or ponytail the tool. So we used to tie or hair back like elastics tend to be very very harsh on the hair and cross Kings in the hair. Which can we can the hair and cause it to break. So the more your hair breaks the longer it's going to take to grow and to look and feel healthy so thats why I personally try to leave my hair down is much as possible but I totally understand if you guys have a job or you're going to school.Or you have a certain situation that doesn't unable you to leave your hair down all the time and you have to put your hair up more often that you would like to. In that case I recommend using tools that are very, very gentle on your hair a lot more gentle then like conventional elastic. So some of my personal favorite ways to tie my hair back is using soft scrunchies you sing a hair clip and also using a silk scarf or silk tie to tie your hair back. This is actually my favourite ways to tie my hair back because not only is a very effective but it looks so beautiful and so polished.Alright, so most the tips and tricks share with you guys so far. Have mainly been about keeping your scalp really healthy and using natural hair care products. 2 really nourish and hydrate your hair and keep it healthy. Overall all these things are really gonna help your hair grow faster and grow thicker, but I cannot talk about my rapid hair growth secrets without mentioning the ends of hair. Now you're probably wondering why should talking about the ends of the hair in hair growth video when your hair grows from your scalp, and that's because are ends are the oldest pub.Over hair, think about these ends were probably up at my roots maybe 1015 years ago, so they have been through alot. They have been through a lot of die. They have been through a lot of exposure to UV rays have been exposed to extreme cold and extreme heat. So you really really want to make sure that you take care of your end because the healthier.",
